# Lazer Puzzle

This is a prototype of a mini-game concept for a bigger game that we're working on.  I'm building
it out as my "one game a month" project for February 2013.  Art is thanks to [Glenn Martin](http://www.parismartin.com/NewSite/gpm_home.html).

How to play: rotate the pieces until the lasers reach the sensors.  When all the sensors are
activated, you win!

For development you probably want to put a full copy of playcraftjs in here so that playcraftjs/lib
has files in it, and then use dev.html instead of index.html to run the game.  That way you'll
get some development goodies and better debugging (but slower startup time and possibly slower
game performance).
